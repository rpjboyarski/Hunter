# HUNTER
## Agentic Autonomous Network Reconaissance Tool
**Hunter** is an AI agent designed for autonomous network reconaissance of both external and internal networks. 
It uses OpenAI's Agents SDK and AgentOps for tool calling. Note that this tool was created in three hours as a proof of concept for AgentOps Hack Night at UIUC. 

## üõ†Ô∏è Supported Tools
**Nmap**: For scanning internal networks

**Hunter.how**: A free alternative to Shodan, allows for searching of devices on the internet

**Shodan**: The free endpoint for IP enrichment

**Rustscan**: A blazingly fast alternative to nmap, lacks versatility but makes up for it with speed

**Ping sweep**: A special case of nmap, designed for quickly identifying hosts on a network

## Database Integration
Certain tools (currently the ping sweep) will automatically save the results to a NoSQL database, which is human readable and LLM-readable.

## Installation
This tool will not function without a few necessary components:
1. OpenAI API Key
2. AgentOps API Key
3. Hunter.how API Key (Free!)
4. Kali Linux tools (nmap & rustscan)

The API keys must be placed in a .env file in the root directory of the project with the following format:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=REDACTED
HUNTER_API_KEY=REDACTED
AGENTOPS_API_KEY=REDACTED
```

## Usage
After installing `nmap` and `ruststcan` on your host, you need to add your API keys to the `.env` file.
Then, you can use "python3 main.py" to run Hunter.

We are working on providing Dockerfile support to manage dependencies automagically (Dockerfile + run.sh)
